1. **What is the difference between Descriptive Statistics and Inferential Statistics ?**
 - Descriptive statistics are used to summarize the main features of a data distributions while Inferential Statistics are used to draw  conclusions about a large population by using sample data.
 - It relies on graphical representation to get the meaning full information/conclusion while the other on probability distribution and mathematical formulas.
 - It uses techniques like mean, median, mode, standard deviation, range, histogram, box-plot etc while other on Hypothesis testing(t,z, $\chi^2$ test), ANOVA, confidance interval etc.

2. **What are the differences between Population and Sample ?**
* Population is the complete information about the data that we are interested in while the Sample is just subset of population data.
* It is large enough that include the every members of the group while other has relatively samller.
* It represents the complete information about the group of interest while other has all the features of the entire population.

3. **What is Random Sampling? What is its use ?**

---

* It a process of selecting a subset from the population s.t ensures every member of the group in the population has equal chance of getting selected.

* It is used to make generalizations about the population, reducing the bias and extract the meaningfull statistical infrerences.

4. **What is Qualitative Data and Quantitative Data ?**
* It a categorical data which can't be explained in numbers but it can be divided into groups and classes then we can easly explain them with numbers.
* It a numerical data which gives information about the measure of something.

5. **What do we mean by Probability distribution ?**
* It is a function that describes the likelihood of possible outcomes of a random event i.e how likely it is for an event to occur and associates a probability to it.

6. **What is nominal data and ordinal data ?**
* It is a qualitative data which has no inherent order of ranking i.e data does not have any numerical significance associated with them like type of colors, Animal species etc.
* It is also qualitative data which has a defined order of ranking associated with it and some group are given more preference over the others.
