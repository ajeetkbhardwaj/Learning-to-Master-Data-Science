    "# Tree-based methods for regression and classification\n",
    "- It involves stratifying or segmenting the predictor space into a number of sample regions. \n",
    "- To make prediction for a given observation we use the mean/mode response value for training obsevations in the region to which it belongs.\n",
    "- The set of splitting rules used to segment the predictor space can be summarized into a decision tree, these types of approaches are known as decision tree methods.\n",
    "- Tree-based methods easy to interprete but they are lack in comptativeness with other models like Logistic Regression etc in terms of accuracy.\n",
    "- We discuss : Bagging, random forests, boosting and Bayesian additive regression trees etc. each of them used to produce multiple trees and then combined to yield a single consensus prediction.\n",
    "- Combination of a large number of multiple decision tree can leads to dramatic improvements in prediction accuracy at the expence of the some loss in interpretation."
